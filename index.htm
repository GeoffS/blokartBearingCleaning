			<h1>How I Clean and Re-Pack My blokart<sup>&reg;</sup> Ball-Bearings</h1>
			<p class="normal" style="margin:2% 12% 2% 12%;font-family: Verdana, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;">
				The process is really very easy, but if you want to keep your hands from getting
				attacked by the chemicals and grease, I'll be happy to sell you completely cleaned and packed
				bearings: <a href="http://performancesailingproducts.com/Products_blokart.html#bearings">
				for $20/pair</a> (I also sell them cleaned and ready to lubricate with your own concoction).
			</p>
			<h2>Introduction:</h2>
			<p class="indentSm normal">
				Like most blokart<sup>&reg;</sup> racers I've tried all kinds of lubricants in my bearings.
			</p><p class="indentSm normal">
				I've also tried all kinds of ways to get the OEM grease out of them.<br />
				Many of the techniques probably weren't very good for the bearings (ex. spinning at high-RPM with
				compressed air when they weren't lubricated).<br />
				I was about to purchase an ultrasonic cleaner when I discovered that assembled ball-bearings can be
				damaged by the vibrations.
			</p><p class="indentSm normal">
				I set out to develop a cleaning system that was:
			</p>
			<ol class="indentMed normal">
				<li>Easy to do at home.</li>
				<li>Reasonably quick.</li>
				<li>Didn't use any really nasty chemicals (see the item about doing this at home).</li>
				<li>Didn't spin the bearings when they weren't lubricated (or damage them in any other way).</li>
				<li>Minimized the chance of any contamination getting into the bearing during the process.</li>
			</ol>
			</p><p class="indentSm normal">
				After doing a lot of research, I decided to use an industrial, water-based de-greaser
				at elevated temperature.<br />
				The specific cleaner I choose was <a href="http://www.zepcommercial.com/product/Industrial-Purple-Cleaner-Degreaser-Concentrate">
				ZEP Purple De-greaser</a>. I could get it at my local Menards home-center and it got high praise on
				various mechanic's and machine-shop web-sites.
			</p>

			<h2>Cleaning Preparation:</h2>
			<p class="indentSm normal">
			</p><p class="indentSm normal">
				The first thing I do is clean up my workbench area by sweeping the floor and dusting off the bench-top.
			</p><p class="indentSm normal">
				Next I put down some clean paper or paper-towel to give me a really clean work area.
			</p>
			<h2>Cleaning Step 1 - Make the Cleaning Solution:</h2>
			<p class="indentSm normal">
				The first step is to cover the bottom of a very clean crock-pot with about 1/2" of distilled water.<br />
				Next I add the same amount of de-greaser (for a 50:50 mixture).<br />
				Finally I turn the crock-pot to a setting that will heat the cleaning solution to about 150&deg;F (65&deg;C)
				and let it warm up to temperature (be careful of breathing the solution vapor once it's warmed up).
			</p><p class="center normal">

			</p>
			<h2>Cleaning Step 2 - Remove the Seals:</h2>
			<p class="indentSm normal">
				I typically process 10 bearings at a time.<br />
				The first thing I do is carefully pry off the rubber seals
				from all the bearings and seal them into a container so they won't get contaminated.<br />
				I also check each bearing to make sure it rotates smoothly.
			</p>
			<h2>Cleaning Step 3 - Put the Bearings into the Cleaning Solution:</h2>
			<p class="indentSm normal">
				Next I put the bearings into a wire-basket and submerge them in the cleaning solution:
			</p><p class="center normal">
				<img src="20150813_180812_HDR_2.jpg" />
				<img src="20150813_180822_HDR_v2.jpg" />
			</p>
			<h2>Cleaning Step 4 - Agitate:</h2>
			<p class="indentSm normal">
				Wait.<br />
				It usually takes about 1/2 hour for the cleaning solution to begin loosening the grease.<br />
				Once that happens, I agitate the bearings by dunking the basket in and out of the solution a few times
				every 10 minutes or so.<br />
				Typically, after about an hour the grease has been removed from the bearings.
			</p>
			<h2>Cleaning Step 5 - Rinse:</h2>
			<p class="indentSm normal">
				After the cleaning solution has done it's work, I transfer the bearings to a small container and
				rinse them a number times with distilled water until all the solution is gone.<br />
				This is important because the solution is slightly corrosive, so you don't want any of it left behind
				in your bearings.
			</p><p class="indentSm normal">
				Next I rise the bearings a few times with denatured alcohol to get rid of the water.
			</p><p class="indentSm normal">
				Finally I rinse the bearings a few times with acetone to get rid of any residual oil, grease, alcohol,
				and water (make sure you use a container that won't be attacked by the acetone).
			</p>
			<h2>Cleaning Step 5 - Lubricate and Preserve:</h2>
			<p class="indentSm normal">
				I take the bearings back to my workbench and let them dry for a few minutes.<br />
				Then I dunk them in WD-40 to provide a bit of light lubrication and check again that they all rotate
				smoothly.<br />
				At this point you can put the bearings into storage if you don't want to lubricate them immediately.
			</p>
			<hr />
			<h2>Packing the Bearings with Grease:</h2>
			<p class="indentSm normal">
				I lubricate my bearings with
				<a href="http://www.dowcorning.com/applications/search/products/Details.aspx?prod=02990555&type=PROD" target="_blank">Dow Corning Molykote BG-20</a>
				synthetic grease.
			</p><p class="indentSm normal">
				Originally I would work the grease into the bearing by hand. That worked, but it was messy and slow.<br />
				Now I use a small syringe (without a needle). I inject a bit of grease between each ball in the bearing.
				This forces the greese through to the other side of the bearing.<br />
				Then I replace the rubber seal on the side I injected the grease into. This forces more of the grease through
				the bearing.<br />
				Finally I run the bearing for a minute or so at about 1000 rpm (corresponding to a blokart going about 50mph/90kph).<br />
				I use a rubber sanding sleeve in my drill-press so I can hold the bearing with the un-sealed side up (so the
				grease doesn't ooze out).
			</p>
			<hr />
			<h2>Storing the Bearings:</h2>
			<p class="indentSm normal">
				To keep debris out of the bearings, I like to pack each pair in an individual small zip-lock bag.<br />
				That way when I'm replacing bearings out on the playa or parking lot, I don't run the risk of contaminating
				the other bearings.
